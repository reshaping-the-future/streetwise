# StreetWise
StreetWise is a local community-sourced audio question and answer system.

The system's hardware designs, server platform and accompanying Android app source code will be made available later in 2018 when existing deployments and refinements are completed.

Until then, see the [toolkit website](http://digitalinclusiontoolkit.org/) and [research project website](http://www.reshapingthefuture.org/) for more details and related work.
